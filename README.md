# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis for a subscription service, aiming to identify customer behavior patterns and key trends in subscription renewals and cancellations. Through data analysis using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, insights are derived to guide targeted strategies and improve customer retention.

## Tools Used

- Excel: Utilized for initial data exploration and analysis, including pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, calculate average subscription durations, and generate reports.
- SQL: Employed to extract and analyze key insights from the customer dataset, such as total customers by region, popular subscription types, and subscription durations.
- Power BI: Used for building an interactive dashboard to visualize customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends, enhancing data-driven decision-making through dynamic insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase focused on understanding customer behavior, subscription trends, and key insights into cancellations and renewals. The analysis aimed to answer essential questions such as:

- What are the subscription patterns for different customer segments?
- What is the average subscription duration, and which subscription types are most popular?
- How many customers are in each region, and how do these numbers compare?
- Which subscription type has the highest number of customers?
- Who are the customers that canceled their subscription within the first 6 months?
- What is the average subscription duration for all customers?
- How many customers have subscriptions that last longer than 12 months?
- What is the total revenue generated by each subscription type?
- Which regions have the highest number of subscription cancellations?
- What is the distribution between active and canceled subscriptions?

This EDA provided comprehensive insights that set the stage for deeper analysis and visualization, helping to inform data-driven recommendations.
