# Customer Segmentation & Churn Analysis
## 📌 Executive Summary

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of customer behavior for a subscription-based service, focusing on key metrics like subscription patterns, revenue drivers, and churn rates. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the analysis transformed raw data into actionable business insights. The findings reveal critical trends in customer preferences and retention, identifying areas for strategic intervention to enhance loyalty and increase revenue.

**🎯 Business Goal:** Enable the company to reduce cancellations, improve retention, and design data-driven marketing and pricing strategies.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

As a data professional supporting a subscription-based company, the business needs to understand its customer base to optimize marketing efforts and improve retention. This project addresses:

- What are the core customer segments based on subscription choices and geography?

- What is the revenue breakdown across different subscription types?

- What is the average customer lifecycle, and what factors contribute to cancellations?

## 📊 Key Insights
### **1. Subscription Trends**

- Basic plan dominates → 50% of customers and nearly 50% of revenue (~₦74.7M).

- Premium & Standard each account for 25% → showing limited differentiation between higher tiers.

**Business Impact:** Enhance Premium/Standard offerings to drive upgrades and diversify revenue.

### **2. Regional Distribution**

- Customers evenly spread across regions (25% each).

- Churn varies regionally: North & South show high cancellations (11,250 each), East & West show none.

**Business Impact:** Investigate region-specific causes and deploy tailored retention programs.

### **3. Subscription Duration**

- Average subscription length = 12 months.

- No subscriptions extend beyond a year → indicating a clear churn cliff at 12 months.

**Business Impact:** Launch retention campaigns at 10–11 months and consider multi-year plans.


### **4. Churn Insights**

- Total customers = 75,000.

- 45% canceled, 55% active.

- No cancellations within the first 6 months → issues begin around the 12-month mark.

**Business Impact:** Focus on preventing long-term churn, not short-term.
