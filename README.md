# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis for a subscription service, aiming to identify customer behavior patterns and key trends in subscription renewals and cancellations. Through data analysis using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, insights are derived to guide targeted strategies and improve customer retention.

## Tools Used

- Excel: Utilized for initial data exploration and analysis, including pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, calculate average subscription durations, and generate reports.
- SQL: Employed to extract and analyze key insights from the customer dataset, such as total customers by region, popular subscription types, and subscription durations.
- Power BI: Used for building an interactive dashboard to visualize customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends, enhancing data-driven decision-making through dynamic insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase focused on understanding customer behavior, subscription trends, and key insights into cancellations and renewals. The analysis aimed to answer essential questions such as:

- What are the subscription patterns for different customer segments?
- What is the average subscription duration, and which subscription types are most popular?
- How many customers are in each region, and how do these numbers compare?
- Which subscription type has the highest number of customers?
- Who are the customers that canceled their subscription within the first 6 months?
- What is the average subscription duration for all customers?
- How many customers have subscriptions that last longer than 12 months?
- What is the total revenue generated by each subscription type?
- Which regions have the highest number of subscription cancellations?
- What is the distribution between active and canceled subscriptions?

This EDA provided comprehensive insights that set the stage for deeper analysis and visualization, helping to inform data-driven recommendations.

## Data Analysis Steps

### Excel: Data Exploration and Analysis

**Overview of Excel Analysis**

In this phase of the project, I conducted a thorough exploration of the customer data using Excel, focusing on critical metrics to uncover insights into customer behavior within the subscription service. The analysis began with the creation of pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of customer preferences. By calculating the average subscription duration and identifying the most popular subscription types, I was able to highlight trends in cancellations and renewals, setting the stage for subsequent analyses in SQL and Power BI.

1. Extracting Subscribtion Duration from the Start and End dates column: Created a new column "Subscrition Duration", in the first column, used the formula

```
=(YEAR(F2) - YEAR(E2)) * 12 + (MONTH(F2) - MONTH(E2))
```

I was able to dedraw the average duration was calucated to be 12 hours 

Key inisght: The average subscription duration being calculated as 12 months says that on average, customers are staying with the service for one year. This indicates customer retention trends and implies that the service successfully retains customers for about a year before potential churn.

2. Count of Customers per Subscription Type:

To gain deeper insights into customer preferences, I created a pivot table that summarized the number of customers for each subscription type. The analysis revealed the distribution as follows:

**Key Insight**: The analysis shows that the Basic subscription type is the most popular, accounting for 50% of all customers. Both Premium and Standard subscription types equally share the remaining customer base at 25% each. This insight highlights customer preference for the more affordable tier, suggesting opportunities for upselling strategies or enhanced features in higher-tier plans to attract more customers.

2. Number of Customers per Region

To understand the geographic distribution of customers, a pivot table was created to count the number of customers from each region. The analysis provided the following breakdown:

**Key Insight**: The customer distribution is evenly spread across all regions, with each region contributing exactly 25% of the total customer base. This uniformity suggests consistent market penetration and customer reach across different regions. Future strategies could explore targeted regional marketing campaigns or localized promotions to leverage this balanced distribution for increased customer engagement.


3. Revenue by Subscription Type

To assess the revenue generated from different subscription types, a pivot table was used to summarize the total revenue for each category. The analysis produced the following results:

**Key Insight**: The Basic subscription type dominates revenue generation, contributing nearly 50% of the total revenue. The Premium and Standard subscriptions, while each accounting for 25%, collectively make up the other half of the revenue. This indicates that a significant portion of income is reliant on the Basic plan, emphasizing the importance of this tier to the business. Enhancing the value of Premium and Standard subscriptions could provide an opportunity for boosting overall revenue and diversifying the income stream.

4. Trend of Subscription Types by Region

In my analysis of subscription data, I explored how different subscription types were distributed across various regions. Below is a summary table that shows the number of customers for each subscription type by region:

**Key Insight:** The Basic subscription type is predominantly chosen by customers in the East and North regions, making up 100% of the customer base in these areas. The Premium subscription type is most popular in the South, while the Standard subscription type is only present in the West. This segmentation suggests region-specific preferences, which could inform targeted marketing strategies and service customization to better address regional customer needs.

Subscription Cancellations

To understand the balance between active subscriptions and cancellations, I analyzed the dataset to determine the number of customers who maintained their subscriptions versus those who canceled. The table below presents the findings:

Key Insight:

Out of 75,000 customers, 55% have active subscriptions, while 45% have canceled. The significant cancellation rate highlights a need to explore factors like service quality, pricing, or competition to reduce churn and improve retention.


### Microsoft SQL Server: Data Querying and Analysis
In this section, I conducted a comprehensive SQL analysis of customer subscription data for a subscription service. The goal was to extract key insights regarding customer behavior, subscription types, cancellations, and regional distribution. This analysis helps inform strategic decisions aimed at improving customer retention and service offerings.

1. Loading the Dataset: I first loaded my dataset from Excel into my SQL Server environment to write and validate my queries.

2. Key Insights Queries

I wrote several SQL queries to extract key insights from the dataset and validate previous findings:

---Total Number of Customers from Each Region:

```
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
GROUP BY Region;
```

---Most Popular Subscription Type by Number of Customers:

```
SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY TotalCustomers DESC;
```

---Customers Who Canceled Their Subscription Within 6 Months:

```
SELECT CustomerID, SubscriptionType, DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) AS SubscriptionDuration
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH,SubscriptionStart , SubscriptionEnd) <= 6 AND Canceled = 'True';
```

---Average Subscription Duration for All Customers:

```
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd )) AS AverageDuration
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
```

---Customers with Subscriptions Longer Than 12 Months:

```
SELECT CustomerID, SubscriptionType, DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) AS SubscriptionDuration
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) > 12;
```

---Total Revenue by Subscription Type:

```
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;
```

---Top 3 Regions by Subscription Cancellations:

```
SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Cancellations
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
WHERE Canceled = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellations DESC;
```

---Total Number of Active and Canceled Subscriptions:

```
SELECT Canceled, COUNT(CustomerID) AS TotalSubscriptions
FROM [Customer Data LITA]
GROUP BY Canceled;
```
