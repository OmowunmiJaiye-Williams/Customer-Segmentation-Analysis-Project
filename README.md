# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis for a subscription service, aiming to identify customer behavior patterns and key trends in subscription renewals and cancellations. Through data analysis using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, insights are derived to guide targeted strategies and improve customer retention.

## Tools Used

- Excel: Utilized for initial data exploration and analysis, including pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, calculate average subscription durations, and generate reports.
- SQL: Employed to extract and analyze key insights from the customer dataset, such as total customers by region, popular subscription types, and subscription durations.
- Power BI: Used for building an interactive dashboard to visualize customer segments, cancellations, and subscription trends, enhancing data-driven decision-making through dynamic insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase focused on understanding customer behavior, subscription trends, and key insights into cancellations and renewals. The analysis aimed to answer essential questions such as:

- What are the subscription patterns for different customer segments?
- What is the average subscription duration, and which subscription types are most popular?
- How many customers are in each region, and how do these numbers compare?
- Which subscription type has the highest number of customers?
- Who are the customers that canceled their subscription within the first 6 months?
- What is the average subscription duration for all customers?
- How many customers have subscriptions that last longer than 12 months?
- What is the total revenue generated by each subscription type?
- Which regions have the highest number of subscription cancellations?
- What is the distribution between active and canceled subscriptions?

This EDA provided comprehensive insights that set the stage for deeper analysis and visualization, helping to inform data-driven recommendations.

## Data Analysis Steps

### Excel: Data Exploration and Analysis

**Overview of Excel Analysis**

In this phase of the project, I conducted a thorough exploration of the customer data using Excel, focusing on critical metrics to uncover insights into customer behavior within the subscription service. The analysis began with the creation of pivot tables to identify subscription patterns, enabling a deeper understanding of customer preferences. By calculating the average subscription duration and identifying the most popular subscription types, I was able to highlight trends in cancellations and renewals, setting the stage for subsequent analyses in SQL and Power BI.

1. Extracting Subscribtion Duration from the Start and End dates column: Created a new column "Subscrition Duration", in the first column, used the formula

```
=(YEAR(F2) - YEAR(E2)) * 12 + (MONTH(F2) - MONTH(E2))
```

I was able to dedraw the average duration was calucated to be 12 hours 

Key inisght: The average subscription duration being calculated as 12 months says that on average, customers are staying with the service for one year. This indicates customer retention trends and implies that the service successfully retains customers for about a year before potential churn.

2. Count of Customers per Subscription Type:

To gain deeper insights into customer preferences, I created a pivot table that summarized the number of customers for each subscription type. The analysis revealed the distribution as follows:

Key Insight:

The analysis shows that the Basic subscription type is the most popular, accounting for 50% of all customers. Both Premium and Standard subscription types equally share the remaining customer base at 25% each. This insight highlights customer preference for the more affordable tier, suggesting opportunities for upselling strategies or enhanced features in higher-tier plans to attract more customers.

2. Number of Customers per Region

To understand the geographic distribution of customers, a pivot table was created to count the number of customers from each region. The analysis provided the following breakdown:

**Key Insight**: The customer distribution is evenly spread across all regions, with each region contributing exactly 25% of the total customer base. This uniformity suggests consistent market penetration and customer reach across different regions. Future strategies could explore targeted regional marketing campaigns or localized promotions to leverage this balanced distribution for increased customer engagement.
